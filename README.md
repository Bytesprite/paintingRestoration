## Github

* This is the basic workflow:

1. `clone` (**you only do this once at the beginning**): You copy all the project files from the Github repository onto your computer
2. **DO WORK**: You make your changes (add files, modify stuff, etc.) to the project
3. `pull`: Before you contribute your changes, grab any changes others have made
4. `add`: Stage your modified files to your list of changes
5. `commit`: Add a message about the changes you made
6. `push`: Send all your changes back to the main repository for everyone to see
